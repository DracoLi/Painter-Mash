			<p>Mona Lisa is the portrait of Lisa Gherardini commissioned by her husband Francesco del Giocondo. Leonardo da Vinci became so attached to the painting that he never gave it to the patron. He kept the painting until his death in France. Thus the painting became a property of the French Republic. The painting is known for Gherardini's mysterious smile and the atmospheric background that also illustrates da Vinci's passion for science.
