			<p>In this painting with his trademark non-figurative style, Mark Rothko uses a natural base for his backdrop against which he creates three colour blocks, with a thin strip of red between two larger blocks of yellow and blue. With his work constantly open to interpretation, this work would make a stunning addition to any modern style that is sure to keep your creative juices flowing.
